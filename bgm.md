>2) [Click here ](https://gist.github.com/souravkl11/5a7f42961917ea3926a580a9390e91a5)  and fork the gist and add your Bgm name and its URL in the given format and after finishing, click save

> 3) Get the raw url by clicking on raw and the last step is use: `.Setvar BGM_DB:copied_url`

`Note: If your BGM_DB format is wrong, your bot will face errors and the bgms may not work`
